## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

Necessary libraries are specified in the [requirements.txt](requirements.txt). They will also be installed at the beginning of the main notebook ([explore_dataset](explore_dataset.ipynb))

The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I analyzed the global cost of living dataset from kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mvieira101/global-cost-of-living) to answer the following questions:

1. In which countries are the apartment prices the highest?
2. Are the salaries particularly high in countries with high housing costs?
3. What dependencies exist between the mean salary and costs of living in the cities?

for a blog article on medium.

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There is one notebooks available here to showcase work related to the above questions.
Furthermore, you can run a PEP8 codecheck, if you uncomment L33 in cell 2.

There are some an additional `.py` files that run necessary code. 

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here]().

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>

Must give credit to Miguel Piedade and numbeo.com for the data.  You can find the Licensing for the data and other descriptive information at the Kaggle link available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mvieira101/global-cost-of-living). Otherwise, feel free to use the code here as you would like!
